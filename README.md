# Methodology
## Classification
Data in 8*32 with 8 variables and a window containing 32 data points. In total 3340 pieces.
Labels are 0/1.

## Localization
Data in 8*16 with 8 variables and a window containing 16 data points. In total 6680 pieces.
Labels are Ints in [0,16] where 0 represents "no Inner Wave" and any other number represents the location of inner wave (which pixel).

Under the error of Â±5 pixels, the classification accuracy is 97%.
